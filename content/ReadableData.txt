	Title: CH and the Moore-Mrowka Problem
	Summary:   We show that the Continuum Hypothesis is consistent with all regular spaces
of hereditarily countable $\pi$-character being C-closed. This gives us a model
of ZFC in which the Continuum Hypothesis holds and compact Hausdorff spaces of
countable tightness are sequential.

	Title: A converse of the Banach contraction principle for partial metric spaces
  and the continuum hypothesis
	Summary:   A version of the Bessaga inverse of the Banach contraction principle for
partial metric spaces is presented. Equivalence of that version and the
continuum hypothesis is shown as well.

	Title: Real continuum
	Summary:   Some physical consequences of the negation of the continuum hypothesis are
considered. It is shown that quantum and classical mechanics are component
parts of the multicomponent description of the set of variable infinite
cardinality. Existence and properties of the set follow directly from the
independence of the continuum hypothesis. Particular emphasis is laid on
set-theoretic aspect.

	Title: Deciding the Continuum Hypothesis with the Inverse Powerset
	Summary:   We introduce the concept of inverse powerset by adding three axioms to the
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. This extends the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with
a new type of set which is motivated by an intuitive meaning and interesting
applications. We present different ways to extend the definition of cardinality
and show that one implies the continuum hypothesis while another implies the
negation of the continuum hypothesis. We will also explore the idea of empty
sets of different cardinalities which could be seen as the empty counterpart of
Cantor's theorem for infinite sets.

	Title: Forcing Axioms and the Continuum Hypothesis, part II: Transcending
  ω_1-sequences of real numbers
	Summary:   The purpose of this article is to prove that the forcing axiom for completely
proper forcings is inconsistent with the Continuum Hypothesis. This answers a
longstanding problem of Shelah. The corresponding completely proper forcing
which can be constructed using CH is moreover a tree whose square is special
off the diagonal. While such trees had previously been constructed by Jensen
and Kunen under the assumption of Jensen's diamond principle, this is the first
time such a construction has been carried out using the Continuum Hypothesis.

	Title: The Keisler-Shelah isomorphism theorem and the continuum hypothesis II
	Summary:   We continue the investigation started in [Sh:1215] about the relation between
the Keilser-Shelah isomorphism theorem and the continuum hypothesis. In
particular, we show it is consistent that the continuum hypothesis fails and
for any given sequence $\mathbf m=\langle (\mathbb{M}^{1}_n, \mathbb{M}^{2}_n:
n < \omega \rangle$ of models of size at most $\aleph_1$ in a countable
language, if the sequence satisfies a mild extra property, then for every
non-principal ultrafilter $\mathcal D$ on $\omega$, if the ultraproducts
$\prod\limits_{\mathcal D} \mathbb{M}^{1}_n$ and $\prod\limits_{\mathcal D}
\mathbb{M}^{2}_n$ are elementarily equivalent, then they are isomorphic.

	Title: Problem of water vapor absorption continuum in atmospheric windows.
  Return of dimer hypothesis
	Summary:   Two alternative hypotheses try to explain the origin of the continuum. The
present communication gives new argument in favor of the dimer hypothesis. This
argument is based on the existence of the wide component of line in absorption
spectrum of polyatomic molecules.

	Title: Under the Continuum Hypothesis all nonreflexive Banach space ultrapowers
  are primary
	Summary:   In this note a large class of primary Banach spaces is characterized. Namely,
it will be demonstrated that under the Continuum Hypothesis the ultrapower of
any infinite dimensional nonsuperreflexive Banach space is always primary.
Consequently, any infinite dimensional nonsuperreflexive Banach space can be
isometrically embedded into its primary ultrapowers.

	Title: Some Representation Theorem for nonreflexive Banach space ultrapowers
  under the Continuum Hypothesis
	Summary:   In this paper it will be shown that assuming the Continuum Hypothesis (CH)
every nonreflexive Banach space ultrapower is isometrically isomorphic to the
space of continuous, bounded and real-valued functions on the Parovicenko
space. This Representation Theorem will be helpful in proving some facts from
geometry and topology of nonreflexive Banach space ultrapowers.

	Title: A Formal Proof of the Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis
	Summary:   We describe a formal proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis
($\mathsf{CH}$) in the Lean theorem prover. We use Boolean-valued models to
give forcing arguments for both directions, using Cohen forcing for the
consistency of $\neg \mathsf{CH}$ and a $\sigma$-closed forcing for the
consistency of $\mathsf{CH}$.
