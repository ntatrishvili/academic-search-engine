	Title: Impact of Electron-Electron Cusp on Configuration Interaction Energies
	Summary:   The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration
interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the
pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective
electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the
scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero
electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this
smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.
We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both
with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective
electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of
the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not
significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction
for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to
popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting
factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.

	Title: Electron thermal conductivity owing to collisions between degenerate
  electrons
	Summary:   We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by
electron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gas
taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau
damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic
electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner
crust of a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this thermal conductivity
completely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion
(electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electron
conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.

	Title: Electron pairing: from metastable electron pair to bipolaron
	Summary:   Starting from the shell structure in atoms and the significant correlation
within electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between
two electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the average
correlation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of the
crystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of the
valence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy
band above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap.
In order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we
calculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the
polaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron
pairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to
counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The
interplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested
in the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is
responsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located
on the Fermi surface of the single-electron band.

	Title: Electron Temperature Anisotropy and Electron Beam Constraints From
  Electron Kinetic Instabilities in the Solar Wind
	Summary:   Electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams are nonthermal features
of the observed nonequilibrium electron velocity distributions in the solar
wind. In collision-poor plasmas these nonequilibrium distributions are expected
to be regulated by kinetic instabilities through wave-particle interactions.
This study considers electron instabilities driven by the interplay of core
electron temperature anisotropies and the electron beam, and firstly gives a
comprehensive analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to the
background magnetic field. It clarifies the dominant parameter regime (e.g.,
parallel core electron plasma beta $\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$, core
electron temperature anisotropy $A_{\mathrm{ec}}\equiv
T_{\mathrm{ec\perp}}/T_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$, and electron beam velocity
$V_{\mathrm{eb}}$) for each kind of electron instability (e.g., the electron
beam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electron
beam-driven whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotron
instability, the electron mirror instability, the electron firehose
instability, and the ordinary-mode instability). It finds that the electron
beam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in the
low-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime, and whistler waves in the medium-
and large-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime. It also finds that a new
oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability is driven by the electron beam
with $V_{\mathrm{eb}}\gtrsim7V_{\mathrm{A}}$ in a regime where
$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}\sim0.1-2$ and $A_{\mathrm{ec}}<1$. Moreover, this
study presents electromagnetic responses of each kind of electron instability.
These results provide a comprehensive overview for electron instability
constraints on core electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams in the
solar wind.

	Title: Hamiltonian of a many-electron system with single-electron and
  electron-pair states in a two-dimensional periodic potential
	Summary:   Based on the metastable electron-pair energy band in a two-dimensional (2D)
periodic potential obtained previously by Hai and Castelano [J. Phys.: Condens.
Matter 26, 115502 (2014)], we present in this work a Hamiltonian of many
electrons consisting of single electrons and electron pairs in the 2D system.
The electron-pair states are metastable of energies higher than those of the
single-electron states at low electron density. We assume two different
scenarios for the single-electron band. When it is considered as the lowest
conduction band of a crystal, we compare the obtained Hamiltonian with the
phenomenological model Hamiltonian of a boson-fermion mixture proposed by
Friedberg and Lee [Phys. Rev. B 40, 6745 (1989)]. Single-electron-electron-pair
and electron-pair-electron-pair interaction terms appear in our Hamiltonian and
the interaction potentials can be determined from the electron-electron Coulomb
interactions. When we consider the single-electron band as the highest valence
band of a crystal, we show that holes in this valence band are important for
stabilization of the electron-pair states in the system.

	Title: Electron-Electron Bremsstrahlung Emission and the Inference of Electron
  Flux Spectra in Solar Flares
	Summary:   Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to
the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such
an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$
keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in
general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray
spectrum steeper at high energies.
  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot
produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The
maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of
the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic
for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated
electrons.
  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show
that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is
naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.
Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized
inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both
electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral
index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E
= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron
spectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy
exists.

	Title: Improved scenario of baryogenesis
	Summary:   It is assumed that, in the primordial plasma, at the temperatures above the
mass of electron, fermions are in the neutral state being the superposition of
particle and antiparticle. There exists neutral proton-electron symmetry.
Proton-electron equilibrium is defined by the proton-electron mass difference.
At the temperature equal to the mass of electron, pairs of neutral electrons
annihilate into photons, and pairs of neutral protons and electrons survive as
protons and electrons.

	Title: Exact Electron-Pairing Ground States of Tight-Binding Models with Local
  Attractive Interactions
	Summary:   We present a class of exactly solvable models of correlated electrons. The
models are defined in any dimension $d$ and consist of electron-hopping terms
and local attractive interactions between electrons. For each even number of
electrons less than or equal to $1/(d+1)$-filling, we find the exact ground
state in which all electrons form pairs of a certain type, and thus the models
exhibit an electron-pair condensation.

	Title: Insights into the Electron-Electron Interaction from Quantum Monte Carlo
  Calculations
	Summary:   The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on
both the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum
Monte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used
to quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron
interaction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous
Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the
effective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional
electron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field
factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the
electron gas at metallic densities.
  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At
the compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)
term and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron
interaction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large
cancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than
either term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the
electron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static
electron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less
repulsive for electrons with parallel spins.
  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background
is shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As a
simple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using
the measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.
The net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors
$0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly repulsive for the
other alkali metals.

	Title: Electron-electron interactions in a weakly screened two-dimensional
  electron system
	Summary:   We probe the strength of electron-electron interactions using
magnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons on
liquid helium at 1.22 K. Our data extend to electron densities that are two
orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. We span both the
independent-electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by the
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), and the strongly-interacting
electron regime. At finite fields we observe a crossover from SCBA to Drude
theory as a function of electron density.
